# Conformity Assessment Scheme: Health Data and Information Capability Framework

![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/dgc-cgn/CAS-Health-Data-Info-Cap-Framework)

This conformity assessment scheme is used to assess health information organizations on the collection, use, storage, protection, and distribution of data.

## Overview

CAN/DGSI 100-5:2023 was prepared by the Digital Governance Standards Institute Technical Committee 13 (TC 13) on health data and information, comprised of over 30 thought leaders and experts in identity management and related subjects. This Standard was approved by a Technical Committee formed balloting group, comprised of 3 producers, 3 government / regulator / policymakers, 3 users, and 3 general interests.

Jurisdictions across Canada are modernizing their health data ecosystems to be suitable for the 21st century. As noted in the first report from the Expert Advisory Group on a Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy, we must  ensure individuals have meaningful access to their data to be empowered in their own health; enable providers to have access to data to provide the best care for their patients; and support analytics that leverage the same data to continuously improve health system effectiveness, safety, and efficiency while advancing our knowledge of disease and protecting public health.

Modernizing this health data ecosystem requires coherent and cooperative action across many organizations to achieve these common goals. This standard provides a framework for cooperation across organizations while also providing a framework for modernization within an organization.  

The work to assess within and cross-organizational capabilities will include people across both business lines and organizations and, therefore, be an important first step in advancing data and information governance across the Health Data and Information (HDI) supply chain 

Although the focus of the standard is on organizations governance holding data the Technical Committee strongly believes that Canadians should be able to access their own health information and benefit from it being shared securely between health workers, across health settings, and across jurisdictions. That is why provinces and territories are also asked to agree to adopt common standards and policies related to data.

## Scope of Assessment

The standard specifies the minimum requirements for organizations to define the depth, diversity and complexity of capabilities, including criteria to assess the degree to which the capability is mature and consistently applied across an organizationâ€™s data assets and processes;
